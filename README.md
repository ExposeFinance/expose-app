## Todo List

- DONE: Init repo for CLI
- DONE: Set up Blockchain LLM - (MoM model using OpenAI, Claude & Deepseek - Trained on blockchain data and connected to Thirdweb for realtime data and transactions capabilities)
- DONE: CLI based interface, chat with your agent, make onchain transactions and query live data - helpful tool for researchers and developers too!
- DONE: Init repo for smart contracts (these are simplified â€˜Routerâ€™ contracts for our LLM to work with, our LLM is specifically aware of these contracts in detail, allowing us to delivery consistent UX)
- DONe: Execute arbitrary transactions unchain using natural language (Swaps, Sending crypto, Increment a counter.. so on.)
- DONE: Init repo for APP
- DONE: Basic app layout (built with VERT stack - vite, react, tailwind)
- DONE: Basic chat interface
- DONE: Branding colours for app
- DONE: Voice mode - Chat to your agent using voice! (Leveraging OpenAI Whisper)
- DONE: Add first load tour https://www.cult-ui.com/docs/components/intro-disclosure
- DONE: Text to voice, so it reads out responses
- DONE: User can create wallet by sign up via google


- When I move to wallet page, it deletes the chat context - Make global chat context.
- Customise agent voice, picture & name - Store via localstorage
- Customise add a pre-prompt config to customise that agents context (e.g preferred contracts, networks, addresses)
- ChatGPT like interface with voice mode and large input prompt
- Create basic express backend to store use data
- Notify you intelligently, i.e new coin you might like
- Notify you for changes in your balances (without having to specify what tokens you own)
- Have multiple agents, each with their own pre-prompts and context and chat history (basically a distinct sessionID with a particular agent)
- Multiple chats with a single agent, not just one sessionID per agent
- Settings to turn on and off text to voice, add your wallet addresses, contract addresses etc to GLOBAL context
- Global and local context, for all agent context, and for one agent context
