## Todo List

- [x] Init repo for CLI
- [x] Set up Blockchain LLM - (MoM model using OpenAI, Claude & Deepseek - Trained on blockchain data and connected to Thirdweb for realtime data and transactions capabilities)
- [x] CLI based interface, chat with your agent, make onchain transactions and query live data - helpful tool for researchers and developers too!
- [x] Init repo for smart contracts (these are simplified â€˜Routerâ€™ contracts for our LLM to work with, our LLM is specifically aware of these contracts in detail, allowing us to delivery consistent UX)
- [x] Execute arbitrary transactions unchain using natural language (Swaps, Sending crypto, Increment a counter.. so on.)
- [x] Init repo for APP
- [x] Basic app layout (built with VERT stack - vite, react, tailwind)
- [x] Basic chat interface
- [x] Branding colours for app
- [x] Voice mode - Chat to your agent using voice! (Leveraging OpenAI Whisper)
- [x] Add first load tour https://www.cult-ui.com/docs/components/intro-disclosure
- [x] Text to voice, so it reads out responses
- [x] User can create wallet by sign up via google
- [x] Bug: When user moves wallet page, it deletes the chat context - Make global chat context.
- [x] Customise agent voice, picture & name - Store via localstorage
- [x] Customise user profile
- [ ] Customise add a pre-prompt config to customise that agents context (e.g preferred contracts, networks, addresses)
- [ ] Create basic express backend to store user data
- [ ] Notify you intelligently, i.e new coin you might like
- [ ] Notify you for changes in your balances (without having to specify what tokens you own)
- [ ] Have multiple agents, each with their own pre-prompts and context and chat history (basically a distinct sessionID with a particular agent)
- [ ] Multiple chats with a single agent, not just one sessionID per agent
- [ ] Settings to turn on and off text to voice, add your wallet addresses, contract addresses etc to GLOBAL context
- [ ] Global and local context, for all agent context, and for one agent context
